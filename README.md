Hey everyone -  I made a basic version of the HUM portal. Sending it here because Deepa Ma'am is here too. Spun this up in an hour, check out if you like it, and ping with features you'd like to have. 

You can see the plan submission process here - https://3bd28530.ngrok.io/ 
And teachers can see the plans here - https://3bd28530.ngrok.io/plan

These links will work till ~12 AM, and then go down, so visit the before that if you can.

With this you don't have to open MS word, you can write plans on your phone, and don't even have to email it to the teachers. There's no spokesperson involved at all, each investment submits their own plan. It's just type and submit for you.

If you guys like this, I'll hardcode some data through the week, so you won't have to enter things like the names of the children in your investment, and they'll show up automatically.
